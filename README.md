## Relation to [xcsoar-data-repository](https://github.com/XCSoar/xcsoar-data-repository)

There is a sister repository:
[xcsoar-data-repository](https://github.com/XCSoar/xcsoar-data-repository) that
generates a [repository](http://download.xcsoar.org/repository) file of all the
resources available for [xcsoar's](https://xcsoar.org) File Manager. Files here
are included, and any changes to file names / paths need to be also changed /
added in that repository.
